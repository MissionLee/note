## Scala中apply的用法

Scala中的 apply 方法有着不同的含义, `对于函数来说该方法意味着调用function本身`, 以下说明摘自Programming in Scala, 3rd Edition

Every function value is an instance of some class that extends one of several FunctionN traits in package scala, such as Function0 for functions with no parameters, Function1 for functions with one parameter, and so on. Each FunctionN trait has an apply method used to invoke the function.

在Scala语言中, 函数也是对象, 每一个对象都是scala.FunctionN(1-22)的实例, 其中N是函数参数的数量, 例如我们定义一个函数并复制给一个变量:

scala> val f = (x: Int) => x + 1
f: Int => Int = <function1>
 这里定义了一个接收一个整型变量作为参数的函数, 函数的功能是返回输入参数加1. 可以看到REPL返回参数的toString方法 即 <function0> . 那么如果我们有一个指向函数对象的引用, 我们该如何调用这个函数呢? 答案是通过FunctionN的 apply 方法, 即 FunctionN.apply() , 因此调用函数对象的方法如下: 

scala> f.apply(3)
res2: Int = 4
但是如果每次调用方法对象都要通过FunctionN.apply(x, y...), 就会略显啰嗦, Scala提供一种模仿函数调用的格式来调用函数对象

scala> f(3)
res3: Int = 4

## 应用场景
- 工厂方法
在Scala中可以通过 List.apply(1, 2, 3) 创建一个List对象, apply方法定义在List类的伴生对象中, 像之前所说的, 我们可以简化apply方法, 直接通过 List(1, 2, 3) 创建一个List实例.
```sh
scala> List.apply(1,2,3)
res0: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3)
scala> res0(1)
res2: Int = 2
```
- 集合类

在Scala集合一文中提到过Iterator迭代器的几个子trait包括S`eq, Set, Map都继承PartialFunction并实现了apply方法`, 不同的是实现的方式不一样, 我们可以通过下面的例子来说明apply的应用

复制代码
```sh
scala> Seq(1, 2, 3).apply(1) // 检索
res6: Int = 2

scala> Set(1, 2, 3).apply(2) // 判断是否存在
res7: Boolean = true

scala> Map("china" -> "beijing", "US" -> "Washington").apply("US") // 根据键查找值
res8: String = Washington

scala> Set(1, 2, 3)(2)
res9: Boolean = true

scala> Set(1, 2, 3)(2)
res10: Boolean = true

scala> Map("china" -> "beijing", "US" -> "Washington")("US")
res11: String = Washington
```

关于apply的更多应用场景待后续慢慢积累, 以下这篇文章很好的解释了apply的作用

Mathematicians have their own little funny ways, so instead of saying "then we call function f passing it x as a parameter" as we programmers would say, they talk about "applying function f to its argument x".

In mathematics and computer science, Apply is a function that applies functions to arguments.
Wikipedia

`apply serves the purpose of closing the gap between Object-Oriented and Functional paradigms in Scala`. Every function in Scala can be represented as an object. Every function also has an OO type: for instance, a function that takes an Int parameter and returns an Int will have OO type of Function1[Int,Int].
```scala
 // define a function in scala
 (x:Int) => x + 1

 // assign an object representing the function to a variable
 val f = (x:Int) => x + 1
 ```
Since everything is an object in Scala f can now be `treated as a reference to Function1[Int,Int] object`. For example, we can call `toString method inherited from Any`, that would have been impossible for a pure function, because functions don't have methods:
```scala
  f.toString
```
Or we could d`efine another  Function1[Int,Int] object by calling compose method on f and chaining two different functions together`:
```scala
 val f2 = f.compose((x:Int) => x - 1)
 // first  => f  -> x+1
 // then   => f2(compose)  (x+1)-1 
 // so  f2(2) == 2
 //     f2(n) == n
```
Now if we want to actually execute the function, or as mathematician say "apply a function to its arguments" we would call the apply method on the Function1[Int,Int] object:
```scala
 f2.apply(2)
```

Writing f.apply(args) every time you want to execute a function represented as an object is the Object-Oriented way, but would add a lot of clutter(杂乱) to the code without adding much additional information and it would be nice to be able to use more standard notation, such as `f(args)`. That's where Scala compiler steps in and whenever we have a reference f to a function object and write f (args) to apply arguments to the represented function the compiler silently expands f (args) to the object method call f.apply (args).,

Every function in Scala can be treated as an object and it works the other way too - every object can be treated as a function, provided it has the apply method. Such objects can be used in the function notation:

```scala
// we will be able to use this object as a function, as well as an object
object Foo {
  var y = 5
  def apply (x: Int) = x + y
}


Foo (1) // using Foo object in function notation 
```

There are many usage cases when we would want to treat an object as a function. The most common scenario is a factory pattern. Instead of adding clutter to the code using a factory method we can apply object to a set of arguments to create a new instance of an associated class:
```scala
List(1,2,3) // same as List.apply(1,2,3) but less clutter, functional notation

// the way the factory method invocation would have looked
// in other languages with OO notation - needless clutter
List.instanceOf(1,2,3) 
```

So apply method is just a handy way of closing the gap between functions and objects in Scala.
