```sql
Create table If Not Exists stadium (id int, date DATE NULL, people int);
Truncate table stadium;
insert into stadium (id, date, people) values ('1', '2017-01-01', '10');

X city built a new stadium, each day many people visit it and the stats are saved as these columns: id, date, people

Please write a query to display the records which have 3 or more consecutive rows and the amount of people more than 100(inclusive).

For example, the table stadium:
+------+------------+-----------+
| id   | date       | people    |
+------+------------+-----------+
| 1    | 2017-01-01 | 10        |
| 2    | 2017-01-02 | 109       |
| 3    | 2017-01-03 | 150       |
| 4    | 2017-01-04 | 99        |
| 5    | 2017-01-05 | 145       |
| 6    | 2017-01-06 | 1455      |
| 7    | 2017-01-07 | 199       |
| 8    | 2017-01-08 | 188       |
+------+------------+-----------+
For the sample data above, the output is:

+------+------------+-----------+
| id   | date       | people    |
+------+------------+-----------+
| 5    | 2017-01-05 | 145       |
| 6    | 2017-01-06 | 1455      |
| 7    | 2017-01-07 | 199       |
| 8    | 2017-01-08 | 188       |
+------+------------+-----------+
Note:
Each day only have one row record, and the dates are increasing with id increasing.

- 1. display the records which have 3 or more consecutive rows and the amount of people more than 100(inclusive).
- 2. 我自己定义的问题：计算截至每天的总人数
- 3. 注意： 提示了 日期 和 id 是同步增加的，所以简化了计算
```sql
-- 连续3天以上 日访问量大于100
  -- 选出来 大于 100 的日子
  -- 在其中选出 连续日期 > 3
        -- 前两天 都存在
        -- 前后各一天存在
        -- 后两天存在
-- select * from stadium where id in
-- (
--     select * from (
--     SELECT id from stadium where people > 99 
--     )s1
--     where ( s1.id-2 in (select id from s1 )and s1.id-1 in (select id from s1 ))
--     or(s1.id+1 in (select id from s1 )  and s1.id-1 in (select id from s1 ))
--     or(s1.id+2 in (select id from s1 )  and s1.id+1 in (select id from s1 ))
-- );
 
-- 我自己的方法，语法没弄明白，觉得应该用存储过程去做


-- 下面是 连续join 完成的
-- solution 1--------------------
SELECT id, date, people
FROM stadium a
WHERE people >= 100 
        AND (SELECT people FROM stadium b WHERE b.id = a.id + 1) >= 100 
        AND (SELECT people FROM stadium c WHERE c.id = a.id + 2) >= 100 
    OR
      people >= 100
        AND (SELECT people FROM stadium e WHERE e.id = a.id - 1) >= 100
        AND (SELECT people FROM stadium f WHERE f.id = a.id + 1) >= 100
    OR
      people >= 100
        AND (SELECT people FROM stadium g WHERE g.id = a.id - 1) >= 100
        AND (SELECT people FROM stadium h WHERE h.id = a.id - 2) >= 100
-- solution 2 --------------------------
SELECT s1.* FROM stadium AS s1, stadium AS s2, stadium as s3
    WHERE 
    ((s1.id + 1 = s2.id
    AND s1.id + 2 = s3.id)
    OR 
    (s1.id - 1 = s2.id
    AND s1.id + 1 = s3.id)
    OR
    (s1.id - 2 = s2.id
    AND s1.id - 1 = s3.id)
    )
    AND s1.people>=100 
    AND s2.people>=100
    AND s3.people>=100

    GROUP BY s1.id
-- solution 3 ----------------------------
SELECT 
  * 
FROM
  stadium 
WHERE INSTR(
    (SELECT CONCAT(',',GROUP_CONCAT(tmpaa.ids),',') AS ids FROM (SELECT 
      GROUP_CONCAT(id) AS ids
    FROM
      (SELECT 
        id,
        CASE
          WHEN (
            (@prevone := people) < 100 
            OR (@prevone >= 100 
              AND @prevtwo < 100)
          ) 
          THEN @group := @group + 1 
          ELSE @group := @group 
        END AS groupno,
        (@prevtwo := people) AS bb 
      FROM
        stadium,
        (SELECT 
          @group := 0,
          @prevone := - 1,
          @prevtwo := - 1) init) AS tmp 
    GROUP BY tmp.groupno 
    HAVING COUNT(1) >= 3 ) AS tmpaa),
    CONCAT(',', id, ',')
  ) > 0
